<pre>Hi,

I'd like to submit the following revisions to the currently approved
Reciprocal Public License 1.1 on file with the OSI. I've attached both text
and HTML versions of the new revision for easy review, and also detailed th=
e
specific changes and their rationales below.

 =20

I'd really appreciate it if you could find time to discuss this update and
approve it either at your April or May meeting. It would help some of those
who've contacted us about the RPL to make use of an existing OSI license if
we could get the new version approved and posted as the latest revision on
the OSI site. Thanks in advance for you effort in this regard.

The changes between version 1.1 and version 1.3 supplied here focus on
issues raised either by the FSF or by others who have contacted Technical
Pursuit regarding use of the RPL for their own software projects/products.
We have tried with this revision to address those concerns while retaining
the intended goals of the RPL and conformance to OSI requirements.


According to the FSF the Reciprocal Public License is a non-free license
because of three problems:

1. It puts limits on prices charged for an initial copy.
2. It requires notification of the original developer for publication of a
modified version.=20
3. It requires publication of any modified version that an organization
uses, even privately.

In support of reusing the RPL for other open source projects there were two
additional issues:

4. It contained references to a Technical Pursuit License (TPL) in EXHIBIT =
A
(Notice)
5. It required a jurisdiction in Colorado which could not be altered withou=
t
having to rename the license



We've addressed these combined concerns as follows (line numbers refer to
the txt version attached):

1.	Per FSF (1) we no longer restrict prices charged for verbatim copies
thanks to changes in Lines 44-45, 49-50, and 353-355 mirroring the GPLs
stance on this matter.
2.	Per FSF (2) we now only require notification of the community at
large (not Licensor) via posting to a news group, blog, or other indexable
web site per Lines 75-80, 275-283, and 328-332.=20

3.	Per Reuse (4) we adjusted lines 553-567 so EXHIBIT A is clean of
references to Technical Pursuit.
4.	Per Reuse (5), we've adjusted Lines 380-384 to allow jurisdiction
changes without renaming the license.

5.	To also encourage Reuse we removed onerous requirements for
maintaining a CHANGES file by altering lines 69-70, 286-295, and 328-332.
6.	The remaining lines with changes (2, 4, 90, etc) change version
numbers and/or dates for the license itself.

We made the first 2 changes addressing FSF issues in an attempt to get thei=
r
objections down to "you have to release your code" and "you have to say you
released your code" so any remaining objections are limited to the feature
which defines the essense of the RPL -- that you have to reciprocate by
releasing your code, regardless of where or how you might deploy it.

We're not aware of any changes to the license text that would in any way
alter it's conformance to the Open Source Definition, and would ask that yo=
u
review this license and approve it as the "current" RPL version.

To assist you with your review process detailed notes on the changes are
listed below:

Line 2:		Updated version number and effective date.
Line 4:		Updated copyright date
Line 44-45:	Added ", or for physically transferring a copy of the
Licensed Software as you received it." to the end of this clause.
Line 49-50:	Removed "the Licensed Software, or " so this applies only to
"Your Extensions". Also removed " where such reproduction and distribution
involve physical media."
Line 69-70:	Changed "both in the Source Code and in a text file titled
"CHANGES" distributed with " to "in the Source Code of"
Line 75-80:	Changed "Licensor" to "software community". Added
notification text of "by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists,
or web sites where a search engine accessible to the public can index your
post in relationship to the Software, including in such notice a brief
description of the Extensions, the distinctive title used, and instructions
on how to acquire the Source Code."=20
Line 90:		Changed version number.
Line 275-283:	Removed references to Licensed Software, focusing on
Extensions. Require an "Electronic Distribution Medium" for source code.
Line 286-295:	Removed references to CHANGES file and a cross-reference in
documenting modifications making requirements less onerous.
Line 328-332:	Removed references to CONTRIB file, making requirements less
onerous. Replaced "Licensor" with "software community". Updated to allow 1
month after deployment before notification required. Allow notification to
community at large purely via posting to the net.
Line 353-355:	Added " You may also charge a nominal fee for physical
transfer of a copy of the Licensed Software as you received it."
Line 380-384:	Replaced EXHIBIT A alteration option with alteration of
Section 13.8 purely to modify the legal Jurisdiction or Venue to allow
alteration of the notice or jurisdiction and still call it the RPL.

Line 553-555:	Removed option of altering notice via Section 7.1
Line 556-567	Removed references to Technical Pursuit License and TPI.
Notice now refers only to the RPL so no alterations should be necessary.
Updated version numbers/dates.


We'd like to assist the OSI in any way necessary to get this new version of
the RPL approved so that Technical Pursuit and the other companies making
use of the RPL can benefit from a more compassionate version of the license
regarding notification requirements, pricing, etc.=20

Thank you in advance for your attention! Let me know if there's anything yo=
u
need from me to help get v1.3 approved :)

PREAMBLE

This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature, intent=
,
and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this
License. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms =
of
the License and not this Preamble.

This License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being
granted certain rights under the terms of this License to Licensor's Softwa=
re,
whose Source Code You have access to, You are required to reciprocate by
providing equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code o=
f
any Modifications, Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution =
of
same (collectively defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your
Extensions under the terms of this License. In this fashion the available
Source Code related to the original Licensed Software is enlarged for the
benefit of everyone.

Under the terms of this License You may:

a. Distribute the Licensed Software exactly as You received it under the te=
rms
of this License either alone or as a component of an aggregate software
distribution containing programs from several different sources without
payment of a royalty or other fee.

b. Use the Licensed Software for any purpose consistent with the rights
granted by this License, but the Licensor is not providing You any warranty
whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that t=
he
Licensed Software doesn't work properly or causes You any injury or damages=
.

c. Create Extensions to the Licensed Software consistent with the rights
granted by this License, provided that You make the Source Code to any
Extensions You Deploy available to all third parties under the terms of thi=
s
License, document Your Modifications clearly, and title all Extensions
distinctly from the Licensed Software.

d. Charge a fee for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or
liability obligations for Your customers, or for physically transferring a
copy of the Licensed Software as you received it.

Under the terms of this License You may not:

a. Charge for the Source Code to Your Extensions, other than a nominal fee
not to exceed Your cost for reproduction and distribution.

b. Modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices, or
License text in the Licensed Software.

c. Assert any patent claims against the Licensor or Contributors, or which
would in any way restrict the ability of any third party to use the License=
d
Software or portions thereof in any form under the terms of this License, o=
r
Your rights to the Licensed Software under this License automatically
terminate.

d. Represent either expressly or by implication, appearance, or otherwise t=
hat
You represent Licensor or Contributors in any capacity or that You have any
form of legal association by virtue of this License.

Under the terms of this License You must:

a. Document any Modifications You make to the Licensed Software including t=
he
nature of the change, the authors of the change, and the date of the change=
.
This documentation must appear in the Source Code of the Licensed Software =
and
Your Extensions.

b. Make the Source Code for any Extensions You Deploy available in a timely
fashion via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism such as FTP or HTTP downlo=
ad.

c. Notify the software community of the availability of Source Code to Your
Extensions in a timely fashion by posting to appropriate news groups, maili=
ng
lists, or web sites where a search engine accessible to the public can inde=
x=20
your post in relationship to the Software, including in such notice a brief=
=20
description of the Extensions, the distinctive title used, and instructions=
=20
on how to acquire the Source Code.

d. Grant Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalt=
y-
free license under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by =
You

distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code o=
r
executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter o=
r

ust
remain available for no less than twelve (12) months after the date You cea=
se
to Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the
Source Code to each version You Deploy remains available even if the
Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may n=
ot
charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess o=
f
Your actual cost of duplication and distribution.

6.3 Intellectual Property Matters.

a. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third part=
y's
intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by t=
his
License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution tit=
led
"LEGAL" that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficie=
nt
detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such
knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6=
.1,
You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailin=
g
lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained.

b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming
interface ("API") and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are
reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this
information in the LEGAL file.

c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3=
(a)
above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original
creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed =
by
this License.

6.4 Required Notices.

a. License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You
provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which
You contribute, wherever You describe recipients' rights relating to Licens=
ed
Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the "Notice=
")
in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed
Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your
name as a Contributor to the Source Code and accompanying documentation alo=
ng
with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the
Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where=
 a
user would be likely to look for such a notice.

b. Source Code Availability. You must notify the software community of the
availability of Source Code to Your Extensions within one (1) month of the
date You initially Deploy and include in such notification a description of
the Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code. Should
such instructions change you must notify the software community of revised
instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. You must provide
notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, weblogs,
or other sites where a publicly accessible search engine would reasonably b=
e
expected to index your post in relationship to queries regarding the Licens=
ed
Software and/or Your Extensions.

6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warran=
ty,
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not =
on
behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor
for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to an=
y
such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a resu=
lt
of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may also
charge a nominal fee for physical transfer of a copy of the Licensed Softwa=
re
as you received it.

6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by
virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance=
,
fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should b=
e
honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this
License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms o=
f
the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the
conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this Licen=
se.
Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.

7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revise=
d
and/or new versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been publish=
ed

Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published=
 by
Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms
applicable to Licensed Software created under this License.

7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may =
do
only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software
under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusin=
gly
similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains
terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not
use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modificati=
ons
to this License be limited to alteration of Section 13.8 purely to modify t=
he
legal Jurisdiction or Venue for disputes, You may continue to refer to Your=
=20
License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.

NY
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.

11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each
party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly=
,
out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically
disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragra=
ph

Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the
disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor
has thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or
may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the te=
rms
of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended=
 or
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will termin=
ate
immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or =
if
applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically
complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of an=
y
of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed
Software.

12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted
hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the terms
herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming awa=
re

granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License,
shall survive.

12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate
litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributo=
r
against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as "Respondent")
alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent=
,
then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 =
or
4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice
from Respondent (the "Notice Period") unless within that Notice Period You
either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonab=
ly
royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such
Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed
Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable
royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by =
the
parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the
expiration of said Notice Period.

12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement
claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said
Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determinin=
g
the amount or value of any payment or license.

12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination unde=
r
this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to
distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any
distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

13.0 Miscellaneous.

13.1 U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Software is a "commercial item=
,"
as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
"commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software
documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-=
4

ent
to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance, or otherwis=
e.

13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor'=
s
right to acquire, license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute
technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or
otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop, produce, market, o=
r
distribute.

13.4 Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to
enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future
enforcement of that or any other provision.

unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessar=

13.6 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible =
for
You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or
all of the Licensed Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation,
then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the software.

13.7 Export Restrictions. You may be restricted with respect to downloading=
 or
otherwise acquiring, exporting, or reexporting the Licensed Software or any
underlying information or technology by United States and other applicable
laws and regulations. By downloading or by otherwise obtaining the Licensed
Software, You are agreeing to be responsible for compliance with all
applicable laws and regulations.

13.8 Arbitration, Jurisdiction &amp; Venue. This License shall be governed =
by
Colorado law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provi=
des
otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree t=
hat
any dispute relating to this License shall be submitted to binding arbitrat=
ion
under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association. Yo=

h
arbitration proceeding jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of
resolving any dispute under this License. Judgement upon any award made in
arbitration may be entered and enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award attorney's fees and costs of
arbitration to the prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary =
to
enforce its arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in=
 a
civil court of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitl=
ed
to reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The application of the United Nati=
ons
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in an=
y
litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License. Any law or regulat=
ion
that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against th=
e
drafter shall not apply to this License.

13.9 Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement betwee=
n
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
