<pre>All -

Attached you will find a copy of the 1.5 version of the Reciprocal =20
Public License. This license is an upgrade to the Reciprocal Public =20
License, version 1.1, approved in Nov. of 2002 by the OSI.

As stewards of the RPL, used by multiple organizations around the =20
world, we take our responsibility very seriously when it comes to =20
incorporating feedback from a variety of parties as to license =20
improvements. Version 1.5 incorporates a number of improvements =20
suggested by both users of the license and the FSF.

Note that a previous upgrade to the RPL, version 1.3, was proposed =20
back in April 2006 on this list:

<a href=3D"http://www.crynwr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?3:mss:">http://www.crynw=
r.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?3:mss:</a>=20
11460:200604:jdibjjcfcadiapdjgmig

but no action has been taken thus far.

It is our intent, therefore, to submit version 1.5 which contains =20
further changes for approval.

All changes between versions 1.1 and 1.3 can be found on that posting.

All changes between versions 1.3 and 1.5 can be found here:

Preamble:

Replaced with a more expository section defining the rationale and =20
primary differences from earlier licenses.

Section 1.0:

Line 51:		Changed version number.
Line 54: 		Removed "publicly", removed "and Preamble"

Section 1.4:

Line 73:		Added "server" behind FTP

Section 1.7:

Line 81:		Moved old section 1.10 to be section 1.7.

directions on how to obtain a copy"

Section 6.1:

Line 243:		Removed ", whichever is longer", replaced last sentence with
"You may not charge a fee for any copy of the Source Code distributed =20
under
this Section in excess of Your actual cost of duplication and =20
distribution of
said copy."

Section 6.2:

Line 251:		Removed "the authors of such Modifications, , and the =20
dates of
any such additions, changes or deletions". Added " without written =20
permission
of the respective Licensor or Contributor" to final sentence.

Section 6.3a:

Line 265:		Replaced "text file" with "human-readable file", replaced =20
"the
Source Code" with "Your", removed "titled "LEGAL"", replaced "LEGAL" =20
with
"human-readable", removed "If You obtain such knowledge after You =20
make any
Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly =20
modify the
human-readable file in all copies You make available thereafter and =20
shall take
other reasonable steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the =20
Licensed
Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained."

Section 6.3b:

Line 272:		Replaced "the LEGAL file" with "a human-readable file =20
supplied
with Your distribution."

Line 281:		Added " or instructions on how to acquire a copy".

Section 6.4b

Line 286:		Split license notice section into its own paragraph.
Line 286:		Changed "the" to "any" in reference to "the notice =20
contained in"
Line 292:		Removed " (such as a relevant directory file)"

Section 6.4d:

Line 306:		Added section explaining that new EXHIBIT B, containing each
contributor's attribution information, must be duplicated into each
user-visible display of the software and at least one place in the =20
software
documentation

Line 309:		Removed ", branding"
Line 311:		Changed "attribution beneath all preceding" to "element of =20
any"

Section 6.5:

Line 319:		Added "except as permitted under other agreements between you
and Licensor or Contributor", removed " You may also charge a nominal =20
fee for
physical transfer of a copy of the Licensed Software as you received it"

Line 337:		Removed "and/or new "

Section 7.1:

Line 344:		Added language specifying that additions to EXHIBIT A or
EXHIBIT B would allow the license to continue to be referred to as =20
the RPL.

Line 350:		Reworked changes section to read "alteration of a) Section =20
13.8
solely to modify the legal Jurisdiction or Venue for disputes, b) =20
EXHIBIT A
solely to define  License Notice text, or c) to EXHIBIT B solely to =20
define a
User-Visible Attribution Notice,"

EXHIBIT A:

Line 535:		Changed warranty notice to be LICENSOR instead of TECHNICAL
PURSUIT INC.

EXHIBIT B:

Line 542:		Added new exhibit to allow contributors to specify =20
attribution
that is required to be displayed in a 'user visible' way.


As stated by Scott Shattuck, author of the RPL, at the end of the =20
version 1.3 posting, any assistance that can be provided by Scott or =20
myself to approve this 'even more compassionate' version of the RPL =20
is available to those who may need it.

Thanks!

<p class=3D"p5">In short, this license grew out of a desire to close loopho=
les in previous open source licenses, loopholes that allowed parties to acq=
uire open source software and derive financial benefit from it without havi=
ng to release their improvements or derivatives to the community which enab=
led them. This occurred any time an entity did not release their applicatio=
n to a "third party".</p>
<p class=3D"p6"><br></p>
<p class=3D"p5">While there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing=
, it struck the authors of the RPL as being unfair to the open source commu=
nity at large and to the original authors of the works in particular. After=
 all, bug fixes, extensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were n=
ot consistently finding their way back into the community where they could =
fuel further, and faster, growth and expansion of the overall open source s=
oftware base.</p>
<p class=3D"p6"><br></p>
<p class=3D"p5">While you should clearly read and understand the entire lic=
ense, the essence of the RPL is found in two definitions: "Deploy" and "Req=
uired Components".</p>
<p class=3D"p6"><br></p>
<p class=3D"p5">Regarding deployment, under the RPL your changes, bug fixes=
, extensions, etc. must be made available to the open source community at l=
arge when you Deploy in any form -- either internally or to an outside part=
y. Once you start running the software you have to start sharing the softwa=
re.</p>
<p class=3D"p6"><br></p>
<p class=3D"p5">Further, under the RPL all components you author including =
schemas, scripts, source code, etc. -- regardless of whether they're compil=
ed into a single binary or used as two halves of client/server application =
-- must be shared. You have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice o=
f it.</p>
<p class=3D"p6"><br></p>
<p class=3D"p5">In addition to these goals, the RPL was authored to meet th=
e requirements of the Open Source Definition as maintained by the Open Sour=
ce Initiative (OSI).</p>
<p class=3D"p6"><br></p>
<p class=3D"p5">The specific terms and conditions of the license are define=

<pre>Reciprocal Public License (RPL)

Version 1.5, July 15, 2007

Copyright (C) 2001-2007
Technical Pursuit Inc.,=20
All Rights Reserved.=20


PREAMBLE

The Reciprocal Public License (RPL) is based on the concept of reciprocity =
or,
if you prefer, fairness.

In short, this license grew out of a desire to close loopholes in previous =
open
source licenses, loopholes that allowed parties to acquire open source soft=
ware
and derive financial benefit from it without having to release their
improvements or derivatives to the community which enabled them. This occur=
red
any time an entity did not release their application to a "third party".

While there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the
authors of the RPL as being unfair to the open source community at large an=
d to
the original authors of the works in particular. After all, bug fixes,
extensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently
finding their way back into the community where they could fuel further, an=
d
faster, growth and expansion of the overall open source software base.

While you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essenc=
e of
the RPL is found in two definitions: "Deploy" and "Required Components".

Regarding deployment, under the RPL your changes, bug fixes, extensions, et=
c.
must be made available to the open source community at large when you Deplo=
y in
any form -- either internally or to an outside party. Once you start runnin=
g
the software you have to start sharing the software.

Further, under the RPL all components you author including schemas, scripts=
,
source code, etc. -- regardless of whether they're compiled into a single
binary or used as two halves of client/server application -- must be shared=
.
You have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it.

In addition to these goals, the RPL was authored to meet the requirements o=
f
the Open Source Definition as maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI=
).=20

The specific terms and conditions of the license are defined in the remaind=
er

intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by t=
his
License, You must include a human-readable file with Your distribution that
describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail tha=
t a
recipient will know whom to contact.

b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming

reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this
information in a human-readable file supplied with Your distribution.=20

c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3=
(a)
above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original
creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed =
by
this License.=20

6.4 Required Notices.=20

a. License Text. You must duplicate this License or instructions on how to
acquire a copy in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code =

recipients' rights relating to Licensed Software.

b. License Notice. You must duplicate any notice contained in EXHIBIT A (th=
e
"License Notice") in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribut=
e
of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, Y=
ou
may add Your name as a Contributor to the Source Code and accompanying
documentation along with a description of the contribution. If it is not
possible to put the License Notice in a particular Source Code file due to =
its
structure, then You must include such License Notice in a location where a
user would be likely to look for such a notice.

c. Source Code Availability. You must notify the software community of the
availability of Source Code to Your Extensions within one (1) month of the =
date
You initially Deploy and include in such notification a description of the
Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code. Should such
instructions change you must notify the software community of revised
instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. You must provide
notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, weblogs,=
 or
other sites where a publicly accessible search engine would reasonably be
expected to index your post in relationship to queries regarding the Licens=
ed
Software and/or Your Extensions.

d. User-Visible Attribution. You must duplicate any notice contained in
EXHIBIT B (the "User-Visible Attribution Notice") in each user-visible disp=
lay
of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions which delineates copyright,
ownership, or similar attribution information. If You create an Extension,
You may add Your name as a Contributor, and add Your attribution notice, as=
 an
equally visible and functional element of any User-Visible Attribution Noti=
ce
content. To ensure proper attribution, You must also include such User-Visi=
ble
Attribution Notice in at least one location in the Software documentation
where a user would be likely to look for such notice.

6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warran=
ty,
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not =
on
behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor except as permitted under other
agreements between you and Licensor or Contributor. You must make it clear =
that
any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by=
 You
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor=
 for
any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any su=
ch
action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by
virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance=
,
fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should b=
e
honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this
License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms o=
f
the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the
conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this Licen=
se.
Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.=20

7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revise=
d
versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a
particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under =
the
terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Software un=
der
the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. N=
o
one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to
Licensed Software created under this License.

7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may =
do
only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software
under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusin=
gly
similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains
terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not
use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modificati=
ons
to this License be limited to alteration of a) Section 13.8 solely to modif=
y
the legal Jurisdiction or Venue for disputes, b) EXHIBIT A solely to define
License Notice text, or c) to EXHIBIT B solely to define a User-Visible
Attribution Notice, You may continue to refer to Your License as the
Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.

LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR ANY
SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEAT=
H
OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW T=
HE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.=20

10.0 High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND =
IS
NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE
CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE=
,
SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR
COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, =
OR
WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD
DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAM=
AGE
("HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES"). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM A=
NY
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.=20

11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each
party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly=
,
out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically
disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragra=
ph
is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of
Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the
disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor
has thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or
may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the te=
rms
of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended=
 or
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.=20

12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will termin=
ate
immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or =
if
applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically
complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of an=
y
of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed
Software.=20

12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted
hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the terms
herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming awa=
re
of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software that are properly
granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License,
shall survive.=20

12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate
litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributo=
r
against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as "Respondent")
alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent=
,
then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 =
or
4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice
from Respondent (the "Notice Period") unless within that Notice Period You
either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonab=
ly
royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such
Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed
Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable
royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by =
the
parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the
expiration of said Notice Period.=20

12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement
claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said
Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determinin=
g
the amount or value of any payment or license.=20

12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination unde=
r
this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to
distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any
distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.=20

13.0 Miscellaneous.=20

13.1 U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Software is a "commercial item=
,"
as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
"commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software
documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-=
4
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Software with o=
nly
those rights set forth herein.=20

13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creatin=
g
an agency, partnership, joint venture, or any other form of legal associati=
on
between or among You, Licensor, or any Contributor, and You will not repres=
ent
to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance, or otherwis=
e.=20

13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor'=
s
right to acquire, license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute
technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or
otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop, produce, market, o=
r
distribute.=20

13.4 Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to
enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future=
 enforcement
of that or any other provision.=20

13.5 Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concernin=
g
the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessar=
y
to make it enforceable.=20

13.6 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible =
for
You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or
all of the Licensed Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation,
then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the software.=20

13.7 Export Restrictions. You may be restricted with respect to downloading=
 or
otherwise acquiring, exporting, or reexporting the Licensed Software or any
underlying information or technology by United States and other applicable
laws and regulations. By downloading or by otherwise obtaining the Licensed
Software, You are agreeing to be responsible for compliance with all
applicable laws and regulations.=20

13.8 Arbitration, Jurisdiction &amp; Venue. This License shall be governed =
by
Colorado law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provi=
des
otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree t=
hat
any dispute relating to this License shall be submitted to binding arbitrat=
ion
under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association. Yo=
u
further agree that Adams County, Colorado USA is proper venue and grant suc=
h
arbitration proceeding jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of
resolving any dispute under this License. Judgement upon any award made in
arbitration may be entered and enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award attorney's fees and costs of
arbitration to the prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary =
to
enforce its arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in=
 a
civil court of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitl=
ed
to reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The application of the United Nati=
ons
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in an=
y
litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License. Any law or regulat=
ion
that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against th=
e
drafter shall not apply to this License.=20

13.9 Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement betwee=
n
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.=20
