On a completely different topic, I would like to open discussion (if  
there is any) on the Reciprocal Public License (RPL) version 1.5  
upgrade, submitted by myself to this list on July 24th, 2007:

RPL version 1.1 was approved in November of 2002 and is currently in  
use by a number of organizations worldwide. This version of the  
license makes a number of changes as per suggestions from both these  
organizations and the FSF.

If no one has any discussion points regarding this license, then I  
would respectfully request that this license be considered for  
approval at the next board meeting.

Thanks very much.
